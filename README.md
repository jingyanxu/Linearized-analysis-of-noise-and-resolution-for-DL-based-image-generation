An online repository for the paper:

Xu, J and Noo, F. "Linearized-analysis-of-noise-and-resolution-for-DL-based-image-generation." Here is the [link](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2022.3214475) to the journal site. 

The code examples and the trained models will be included soon.
The supplementary information can be accessed from [supplement.pdf](https://github.com/jingyanxu/Linearized-analysis-of-noise-and-resolution-for-DL-based-image-generation/blob/main/supplement.pdf)

An example of computing forward gradient using double backward autodiff in PyTorch can be found in [example.py](https://github.com/jingyanxu/Linearized-analysis-of-noise-and-resolution-for-DL-based-image-generation/blob/main/example.py)

**If you are looking for the source code of the paper, I apologize for the delay. It has something to do with [this.](https://github.com/jingyanxu/Linearized-analysis-of-noise-and-resolution-for-DL-based-image-generation/blob/main/PXL_20220914_172013030.mp4) I am working on the replacement code. But it will take me some time. Please check back here late November.**
